### When You're Eliminated
You are eliminated when:
- Your picked team loses
- Your picked team draws
- You fail to make a pick before the deadline
- You run out of lives (if lives system is active)

### Lives System {#lives-system}
Competitions can have 0-3 lives:
- **0 Lives (Knockout)**: One wrong pick = immediate elimination
- **1 Life**: Survive one wrong pick, eliminated on the second
- **2 Lives**: Survive two wrong picks, eliminated on the third
- **3 Lives**: Survive three wrong picks, eliminated on the fourth

## Team Selection Rules

### No Team Twice Rule
When enabled (most competitions):
- You cannot select the same team in multiple rounds
- Keeps a record of all your previous picks

- Only teams with fixtures that round are pickable

## Match Result Rules

### What Counts as a Win
- Victory in 90 minutes + stoppage time
- Extra time and penalties do NOT count
- If the match goes to extra time, it counts as a draw for LMS

### Postponed Matches
- Usually treated as void (no result)
- Players who picked affected teams typically get a free pass
