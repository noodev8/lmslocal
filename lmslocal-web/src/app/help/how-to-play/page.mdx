# How to Play Last Man Standing

Last Man Standing is an elimination-style competition where players pick one winning team each round. Get it wrong, and you could be eliminated!

## The Basic Concept

**One Pick, One Chance** - Each round, you select one team you think will win their match. If your team wins, you advance to the next round. If they lose or draw, you may be eliminated (depending on the competition's lives setting).

## Key Rules

### 1. No Team Twice Rule
Most competitions enforce the "No Team Twice" rule:
- You cannot pick the same team in different rounds
- This makes the competition progressively harder
- Teams reset when all players run out of available options

### 2. Pick Deadlines
- Picks lock 1 hour before the first match kicks off
- Organizers can set earlier deadlines
- Missing a pick counts as a loss

### 3. Match Results
- **Win** = You advance to the next round
- **Draw** = Counts as a loss (you may lose a life)
- **Loss** = Counts as a loss (you may lose a life)
- Results based on 90 minutes + stoppage time only

## Lives System

Your organizer chooses how many lives players get:

- **0 Lives (Knockout)** - One wrong pick and you're out
- **1 Life** - You can survive one wrong pick
- **2 Lives** - You can survive two wrong picks
- **3 Lives** - You can survive three wrong picks

## How to Win

Be the last player standing! The competition continues until:
- Only one player remains (they win)
- Multiple players are eliminated in the same round (they share the prize)
- The organizer ends the competition

## Strategy Tips

1. **Save strong teams** - Don't use all the best teams early
2. **Watch the fixtures** - Some rounds have easier matches than others
3. **Track other players** - Know which teams others might pick
4. **Plan ahead** - Look at upcoming fixtures before making picks
