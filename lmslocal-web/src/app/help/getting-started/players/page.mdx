## Making Your First Pick

### Step 1: View Available Fixtures

## Understanding the Rules

### Basic Rules
- **One pick per round** - Choose wisely
- **Win = Advance** - Your team must win (not draw)
- **Deadline matters** - Late picks aren't accepted

### Lives System
Your competition may have lives:
- **0 lives**: One wrong pick = eliminated
- **1+ lives**: You can survive that many wrong picks

### Results
- Based on 90 minutes + stoppage time
- Extra time/penalties don't count
- Postponed matches may be void (check with organizer)

## Tips for Success

### DO:
- ✅ Check fixtures early each week
- ✅ Make picks well before deadline
- ✅ Track which teams you've used
- ✅ Consider opponent strength
- ✅ Save strong teams for difficult rounds

### DON'T:
- ❌ Wait until the last minute
