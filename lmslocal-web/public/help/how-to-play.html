    <h1>How to Play Last Man Standing</h1>

<p>Simply pick one team in the Premier League to WIN each week. If your selected team WINS you continue onto the next week. If your team LOSES or DRAWS, then you are out. You cannot pick the same team twice.</p>

<p>LMS Local allows caveats and twists to the standard rules. As an organiser, you can choose how many lives a player has. Once out of lives, they are eliminated. An organiser can also choose to follow the "one team" rule or not.</p>

<h2>Core Rules</h2>

<h3>‚úÖ How to Win</h3>
<ul><li>Your selected team must <strong>WIN</strong> their match</li>
<li>Results based on 90 minutes + stoppage time only</li>
<li>Extra time and penalties don't count</li>
<li>You advance to the next round</li>

<h3>‚ùå How to Lose a Life</h3>
<li>Your team <strong>LOSES</strong> their match</li>
<li>Your team <strong>DRAWS</strong> their match</li>
<li>You miss the pick deadline</li>
<li>You forget to make a pick</li>

<h2>Team Selection Rules</h2>

<h3>1. No Team Twice Rule</h3>
<p>Once you pick a team, you cannot pick them again for the entire competition. This makes each round progressively more challenging as your options decrease.</p>

<h3>2. Organizer Flexibility</h3>
<p>Your organizer can choose to disable the "no team twice" rule, allowing more strategic flexibility throughout the competition.</p>

<h3>3. Team Reset</h3>
<p>If all remaining players run out of available teams, the team restrictions reset and you can pick any team again.</p>

<h2>Lives System</h2>

<p>Your organizer sets how many lives each player gets at the start:</p>

<li><strong>0 Lives (Knockout)</strong> - One wrong pick and you're eliminated immediately</li>
<li><strong>1 Life</strong> - You can survive one wrong pick</li>
<li><strong>2 Lives</strong> - You can survive two wrong picks</li>

<h2>Pick Deadlines</h2>

<p><strong>Default:</strong> 1 hour before the first match kicks off</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Once the deadline passes, you cannot change your pick. Missing the deadline counts as a loss and you'll lose a life.</p>

<p>Your organizer can set earlier deadlines if they prefer, but picks always lock before matches begin.</p>

<h2>Strategy Tips</h2>

<h3>Smart Team Management</h3>
<li>Don't use Manchester City or Arsenal in easy early rounds</li>
<li>Save the strongest teams for difficult fixtures later</li>
<li>Look ahead at upcoming fixtures before picking</li>
<li>Consider which teams others might avoid</li>

<h3>Tactical Considerations</h3>
<li>Home advantage matters - check venue</li>
<li>Consider recent team form and injuries</li>
<li>Derby matches can be unpredictable</li>
<li>Track what teams other players have used</li>

<h2>How to Win the Competition</h2>

<p>Be the <strong>last player standing</strong>! The competition continues until:</p>

<li><strong>Solo Winner</strong> - Only one player remains (they take the prize)</li>
<li><strong>Joint Winners</strong> - Multiple players eliminated in same round share prize</li>
<li><strong>Organizer Decision</strong> - Organizer can end competition at any time</li></ul>

<h2>Ready to Play?</h2>

<p>1. <strong>Join a Competition</strong> - Get an access code from your organizer</p>
<p>2. <strong>Make Your Pick</strong> - Choose your team before the deadline</p>
<p>3. <strong>Track Results</strong> - See if you advance and check the leaderboard</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong> Once you make a pick, you <strong>cannot change it</strong>. Choose wisely! üèÜ</p>
