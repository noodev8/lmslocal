<h2>For Players</h2>

<h3>Can I change my pick?</h3>

<h3>What if I forget to pick?</h3>
<p>Missing a pick counts as a wrong pick. You'll lose a life (or be eliminated in knockout format).</p>

<h3>Can I join multiple competitions?</h3>
<p>Yes! You can join as many competitions as you want with the same account.</p>

<h3>How do I know if I'm eliminated?</h3>
<p>Check your competition dashboard - your status will show as "Eliminated" and you'll see which round you went out.</p>

<h3>What happens if my team's match is postponed?</h3>
<p>Usually, postponed matches are void (no win or loss), but check with your organizer for their specific rules.</p>

<h2>Technical Questions</h2>
