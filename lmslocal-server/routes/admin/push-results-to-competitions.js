API Route: push-results-to-competitions
=======================================================================================================================================
Method: POST
Purpose: Pushes results from fixture_load to competition fixtures and automatically processes them (cron/ad-hoc execution).
         1. Updates fixture.result field with winning team short name or "DRAW"
         2. Only updates fixtures in competitions where fixture_service = true
         3. Automatically processes results (eliminations, no-picks, competition completion)
         4. Only updates fixtures where result is NULL (never overrides existing results)
=======================================================================================================================================
