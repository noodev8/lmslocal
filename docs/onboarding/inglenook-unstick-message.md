## After They Respond Positively:

Send this follow-up:

```
Great! I'm printing your leaflets today (5 copies) and posting them to you.

Quick Guide attached - it's just 1 page showing the 3 simple steps.

Also, here's the WhatsApp group link to share with your customers:
[WHATSAPP_GROUP_LINK]

I've already added you as admin in the group so you can manage it if you want - but I'll handle all the reminders and admin stuff if you prefer!

Leaflets should arrive in 2-3 days. Let me know when they turn up 👍
```

## Notes:

- Wait for their "OK" or positive response before sending follow-up
- Don't send too much info at once
- Keep it simple and reassuring
- The goal is to unstick them from decision paralysis
