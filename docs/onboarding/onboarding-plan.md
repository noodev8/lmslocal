# LMSLocal Onboarding Plan v1.0

**Status:** Active (Free Beta Testing)
**Current Customer:** Inglenook Cafe
**Offer:** Free setup (normally £149)
**Goal:** Learn and refine process before paid rollout

---

## Core Philosophy

**"Done For You" Approach:**
- Build competition FIRST with smart defaults - before contacting pub
- Never ask questions that cause overwhelm or decision paralysis
- Launch with sensible settings even if pub provides zero information
- Customers review finished product rather than making decisions from scratch
- Run the entire competition - pub can be hands-off or hands-on (their choice)

**Psychology Flip:**
❌ Don't ask: "What do you want? When? How much? What settings?"
✅ Instead say: "Your competition is READY with our best-practice settings - here's what we've set up"

**Key Learning (Inglenook):**
Asking too many questions = frozen contact. Build first, present finished product, unstick them with simplicity.

---

## Smart Defaults (No Waiting Required)

**Competition Settings:**
- **Name:** "[Pub Name] Last Man Standing"
- **Entry Fee:** £10 (suggested - pub can tell players different)
- **Prize Structure:** 50% Winner / 50% Charity (suggested - pub decides)
- **Start Date:** 2 weeks from setup
- **Access Code:** Auto-generated memorable code (e.g., "PUBNAME2025")
- **Competition Type:** Premier League fixtures

**Key Principle:** If pub provides ZERO input, we launch with these settings ✅

---

## Execution Checklist (Linear Process)

### STEP 1: Competition Build FIRST (20 mins - Day 0)

**BUILD BEFORE CONTACTING - Critical for "Done For You" approach**

**Manual Setup in LMSLocal:**
1. Create competition: "[Pub Name] Last Man Standing"
2. Set access code: Memorable format (e.g., "INGLENOOK2025")
3. Upload logo if provided (or leave blank for text-only layout)
4. Set entry fee: £10
5. Set prize structure: "50% Winner / 50% Charity"
6. Configure: Standard Premier League fixtures, 1 life per player
7. Set round 1 lock time: Saturday 2 weeks from today, 3pm
8. Generate join link
9. Note competition ID and access code

**Required Information:**
- Pub name (minimum)
- Everything else uses smart defaults

**Competition Assets Ready:**
- ✅ Competition URL (join link)
- ✅ Access Code
- ✅ Leaflet URL (automatically generated at `/leaflet/[ID]`)
- ✅ Admin login credentials (if needed)

---

### STEP 2: Initial Contact - "Done For You" Message (5 mins - Day 0)

**Communication Method:** WhatsApp DM (preferred) or Email

**IMPORTANT:** If contact seems overwhelmed or frozen from previous questions, use the "Unstick Message" template instead.

**Standard "Done For You" WhatsApp/Email:**

```
Hi [Name],

Your Last Man Standing competition is READY! 🎯

We've built it with our best-practice settings that work brilliantly for pubs.

YOUR COMPETITION:
🔗 Join Link: [JOIN_URL]
🔑 Access Code: [ACCESS_CODE]
📅 Start Date: [START_DATE]
💰 Entry Fee: £10
🏆 Prize: 50% Winner / 50% Charity

Here's the best bit - you can be as hands-on or hands-off as you like:

✅ I'LL HANDLE:
• Weekly pick reminders to players via WhatsApp
• Results updates
• All the admin and technical stuff
• Player questions and support

✅ YOU JUST NEED TO:
• Put up leaflets when they arrive (I'm posting 5 to you)
• Share the join link with your customers
• Collect entry fees your way (cash, bank transfer, whatever)

That's it! I'll run the whole thing.

Want to be more involved? Great! Want me to handle it all? Also great!

Sound good? 👍
```

**"Unstick Message" (If Contact Is Frozen/Overwhelmed):**

```
Hi [Name],

Forget all those questions I asked - I've gone ahead and set everything up with our standard settings! 🎯

YOUR COMPETITION IS READY:
🔗 Join Link: [JOIN_URL]
🔑 Access Code: [ACCESS_CODE]
📅 Start Date: [START_DATE]
💰 Entry Fee: £10
🏆 Prize: 50% Winner / 50% Charity

Here's the best bit - you can be as hands-on or hands-off as you like:

✅ I'LL HANDLE:
• Weekly pick reminders to players via WhatsApp
• Results updates
• All the admin and technical stuff
• Player questions and support

✅ YOU JUST NEED TO:
• Put up leaflets when they arrive (I'm posting 5 to you)
• Share the join link with your customers
• Collect entry fees your way (cash, bank transfer, whatever)

That's literally it. I'll run the whole thing.

Want to be more involved? Great! Want me to handle it all? Also great!

Sound good? 👍
```

**Action:**
- Send immediately after building competition (directly to pub contact via WhatsApp DM or email)
- Don't send anything else until they respond
- Wait for positive response before proceeding
- **Note:** WhatsApp group will be created once they respond positively

---

### STEP 3: Leaflet Generation (Instant - Day 0)

**✅ IMPLEMENTED - Automated Leaflet System**

The leaflet is now fully automated using your Next.js app. Each competition automatically gets a printable leaflet page.

**IMPORTANT:** Leaflet URL requires organizer login - **for your use only**, not for sharing with pub.

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Location:** `/leaflet/[competitionId]` page in Next.js app (requires authentication)
- **Technology:** React + Tailwind CSS with print-optimized styling
- **QR Code:** Auto-generated using `qrcode` npm package (free)
- **Data Source:** Fetches from `promoteApi.getPromoteData()` endpoint
- **Fully Responsive:** Beautiful on screen, perfect for printing
- **Access:** Organizer only (verifyToken required)

**How It Works:**
1. Create competition in system → Get competition ID (e.g., 47)
2. Leaflet automatically available at: `https://lmslocal.com/leaflet/47`
3. Page fetches competition data (name, access code, join URL)
4. Auto-generates QR code from join URL
5. Displays in A4 print-ready format

**What's Included (Automatically):**
- ✅ Competition name (from database)
- ✅ Competition logo (from database, if provided)
- ✅ Access code (from database)
- ✅ Join URL (from database - points to main site)
- ✅ QR code (auto-generated - scans to main site)
- ✅ Entry fee (from database, with smart fallback)
- ✅ Prize structure (from database, with smart fallback)
- ✅ Start date (from round 1 lock_time, with smart fallback)
- ✅ Lives per player (dynamic rules text based on setting)
- ✅ How to join instructions (4-step process)
- ✅ Game rules (dynamic based on lives setting)
- ✅ Professional A4 layout
- ✅ Print-optimized CSS

**Smart Fallbacks (UK English):**
- Entry Fee: "Check with organiser" (if not set)
- Start Date: "Check with organiser" (if round 1 not configured)
- Prize: "Contact organiser" (if not set)
- All text uses British spelling throughout

**Your Workflow:**
1. Create competition → Note the competition ID
2. Login to your account and visit: `https://lmslocal.com/leaflet/[ID]`
3. Click "Print Leaflet" button
4. Save as PDF
5. Print 5 physical copies in office
6. Post physical copies to pub (do NOT share leaflet URL - it requires login)

**Quick Access:**
- From game dashboard → Promote → "View & Print" leaflet card
- Direct URL: `https://lmslocal.com/leaflet/[COMPETITION_ID]`
- Leaflet card hidden once round 1 starts (no longer needed for recruitment)

**Output Options:**
- **Screen View:** Beautiful preview with "Print" button (organizer only)
- **Print to PDF:** Browser's built-in print-to-PDF (free)
- **Direct Print:** Send to printer for physical copies

**Physical Printing:**
- Use browser's print-to-PDF for the 5 copies
- Print directly in office OR send to local print shop
- Post 5 physical copies to pub
- Future options: Public leaflet URL (no login) or paid bulk printing service (50+ copies)

---

### STEP 4: Delivery Package - When They Respond Positively (10 mins - Day 1)

**Wait for:** Positive response to "Done For You" message (e.g., "OK", "Sounds good", "👍")

**IMPORTANT:** Don't send anything else until they acknowledge the initial message. Don't overwhelm.

**Once They Respond:**

**1. CREATE WHATSAPP GROUP (First Action):**
- Create new WhatsApp group: "[Pub Name] Last Man Standing"
- Add pub contact as first member (and admin)
- Pin welcome message in group (see template below)
- Get shareable group link (Group info → Invite via link)

**WhatsApp Group Pinned Message Template:**
```
Welcome to [Pub Name] Last Man Standing! ⚽

Join the competition:
🔗 [JOIN_URL]
🔑 Code: [ACCESS_CODE]

📅 Starts: [START_DATE]
💰 Entry: £10 (pay at [Pub Name])
🏆 Prize: 50% Winner / 50% Charity

Rules: Pick one team each week. Win = stay alive. Can't repeat teams.

I'll send reminders before each round locks.

Questions? Ask here anytime! Good luck 🍀

- [Your Name], LMSLocal
```

**2. SEND DELIVERY MESSAGE (After Group Created):**

**WhatsApp/Email Message:**

```
Great! I'm printing your leaflets today (5 copies) and posting them to you.

Quick Guide attached - it's just 1 page showing the 3 simple steps.

Also, I've created the WhatsApp group for players and added you as admin:
[WHATSAPP_GROUP_LINK]

Share this link with your customers - they can join the group and get weekly reminders!

I'll handle all the reminders and admin stuff in the group, but you can post too if you want 👍

Leaflets should arrive in 2-3 days. Let me know when they turn up!
```

**Attachments (if Email):**
1. Quick Start Guide PDF (1 page - don't overwhelm)

**Actions Checklist:**
- ✅ Create WhatsApp group with pub contact
- ✅ Pin welcome message in group
- ✅ Set pub contact as admin
- ✅ Get shareable group link
- ✅ Send delivery message with group link
- ✅ Print 5 leaflets (print to PDF, then print physically)
- ✅ Post leaflets to pub address
- ✅ Attach Quick Start Guide if using email

**WhatsApp Group Management:**
- You are primary admin and manager
- Pub contact is also admin (for credibility and flexibility)
- You handle all reminders, updates, and player questions
- Pub can post if they want, but doesn't have to
- Share group link with pub to share with their customers

---

### STEP 5: Leaflet Arrival Follow-Up (5 mins - Day 3-5)

**Wait for:** Pub to confirm leaflets arrived OR 3-5 days after posting

**When Leaflets Arrive:**

**WhatsApp Message:**

```
Brilliant! Time to get the word out 📣

Pop those 5 leaflets up around the pub:
• On the bar
• On tables
• Notice boards
• Anywhere customers will see them

And share the WhatsApp group link with your regulars:
[WHATSAPP_GROUP_LINK]

I'll start welcoming players in the group as they join!

How many entries so far?
```

**If No Confirmation After 5 Days:**

```
Hi [Name],

Have the leaflets arrived yet? Should have been 5 copies.

Once they turn up, just pop them around the pub and share the WhatsApp group link with customers!

Let me know if you need anything 👍
```

**Goal:** Prompt action on promotion without being pushy

---

### STEP 6: Full Competition Management (Ongoing)

**You run the entire competition - pub can be hands-off if they want!**

**1 Week Before Start:**

**WhatsApp Message to Pub:**
```
Competition starts [DATE] - just 1 week to go! 🎯

How many entries do we have so far?

Give it a final push this week - share the join link and WhatsApp group with anyone who hasn't joined yet!

I'll handle all the reminders and admin from launch day 👍
```

**Launch Day:**

**WhatsApp Message to Pub:**
```
Good luck! Competition starts today 🍀

I'll be managing the WhatsApp group and sending pick reminders to all players.

You just collect the entry fees and enjoy the buzz!

Let me know if you need anything.
```

**WhatsApp Message to Players Group:**
```
🎯 ROUND 1 IS LIVE!

Get your picks in before [LOCK_TIME] on [DATE]

Remember: Win = stay alive, Draw/Loss = eliminated

Good luck everyone! ⚽
```

- ✅ Send pick reminders to WhatsApp group before each round
- ✅ Post results updates after each round
- ✅ Answer player questions in group

**Check-in with Pub (Mid-Competition):**
```
How's it going? Competition at round [X] - [Y] players still alive!

Is the buzz good in the pub?

Let me know if you need anything 👍
```

**Post-Competition:**

**Message to Pub:**
```
Congratulations! Competition finished 🎉

Winner: [PLAYER_NAME]

How did it go? Would love your feedback!

Would you like to run another one? Could make it a regular thing 👍
```

**Actions:**

---

## The Psychology Flip in Action

**Initial Contact:**
- ❌ Don't Ask: "What do you want? When? How much? What settings?"
- ✅ Present: "Your competition is READY! Here's what we've set up..."

**Competition Settings:**
- ❌ Don't Ask: "What entry fee do you want?"
- ✅ Present: "Entry fee: £10 (our most popular)" - no question needed

**Workload:**
- ❌ Don't Say: "You'll need to manage the competition..."
- ✅ Say: "I'll handle everything - you can be completely hands-off if you want!"

**Flexibility:**
- ❌ Don't Say: "You have to do X, Y, Z..."
- ✅ Say: "You can be hands-on OR hands-off - totally up to you!"

**When They're Frozen/Overwhelmed:**
- ❌ Don't Ask: More questions or wait for responses
- ✅ Present: "Forget those questions - it's all done! Here's what we built..."

**Key Learning:** Presenting finished product with "Done For You" messaging prevents decision paralysis. They review, not build from scratch.
