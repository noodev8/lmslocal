# PAYG Credit System - Implementation Plan

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-21 - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
**Status:** Database migrated ‚úÖ | Core credit APIs built ‚úÖ | Payment APIs built ‚úÖ | Frontend complete ‚úÖ

---

## Executive Summary

Migrated from annual subscription tiers to Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) credit-based pricing.

**Old System:**
- Free (20 players), Club (50 players - ¬£79/year), Venue (200 players - ¬£179/year)
- Annual payments, fixed tiers

**New System:**
- First 20 players across all competitions: FREE
- Players 21+: Deduct from paid credits (1 credit = 1 player)
- Credit packs: ¬£10/15 credits, ¬£20/40 credits, ¬£40/100 credits
- Credits expire after 12 months (T&Cs only - no automatic enforcement)
- No refunds once player joins (like phone PAYG)

---

## Database Schema (FINAL - COMPLETED)

### Tables Created

#### 1. `credit_purchases`
Payment records when users buy credit packs.

```sql
CREATE TABLE credit_purchases (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES app_user(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  pack_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,           -- 'starter_15', 'popular_40', 'value_100'
  credits_purchased INTEGER NOT NULL,        -- 15, 40, or 100
  stripe_subscription_id VARCHAR(100),       -- Stripe session ID
  stripe_customer_id VARCHAR(100),
  paid_amount NUMERIC(10,2) NOT NULL,        -- Amount paid in GBP
  promo_code_id INTEGER REFERENCES promo_codes(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  original_price NUMERIC(10,2),              -- Price before discount
  discount_amount NUMERIC(10,2),             -- Discount applied
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Indexes:**
- `idx_credit_purchases_user_id` on `user_id`
- `idx_credit_purchases_stripe_session` on `stripe_subscription_id`
- `idx_credit_purchases_created_at` on `created_at DESC`

#### 2. `credit_transactions`
Complete audit log of all credit movements.

```sql
CREATE TABLE credit_transactions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES app_user(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  transaction_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,     -- See types below
  amount INTEGER NOT NULL,                   -- Positive (add) or negative (deduct)
  competition_id INTEGER REFERENCES competition(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  purchase_id INTEGER REFERENCES credit_purchases(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  description TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

COMMENT ON COLUMN credit_transactions.transaction_type IS 'Type of credit movement: purchase (credits bought), deduction (player joined competition over free limit), expiry (batch expired after 12 months), admin_adjustment (manual admin change)';
```

**Transaction Types:**
- `'purchase'` - Credits bought via Stripe (+amount, links to purchase_id)
- `'deduction'` - Player joined competition over 20 free limit (-amount, links to competition_id)
- `'expiry'` - Admin manually expired old credits (-amount, manual process)
- `'admin_adjustment'` - Support/admin manual adjustment (+/- amount)

**Indexes:**
- `idx_credit_transactions_user_id` on `user_id`
- `idx_credit_transactions_type` on `transaction_type`
- `idx_credit_transactions_created_at` on `created_at DESC`
- `idx_credit_transactions_competition` on `competition_id`

#### 3. `app_user.paid_credit` (Column Added)
Current available paid credit balance.

```sql
ALTER TABLE app_user ADD COLUMN paid_credit INTEGER DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL;
```

**What it represents:**
- Credits purchased but not yet used
- Does NOT include the 20 free players
- Decremented when player 21+ joins a competition

### Tables Modified

**`promo_code_usage`** - Renamed column for credit packs:
```sql
ALTER TABLE promo_code_usage RENAME COLUMN plan_purchased TO pack_purchased;
```

### Tables Removed

- ‚ùå `subscription` (replaced by `credit_purchases`)
- ‚ùå `user_allowance` (no longer needed)
- ‚ùå `app_user.subscription_plan` (removed)
- ‚ùå `app_user.subscription_expiry` (removed)

---

## Business Rules (FINALIZED)

### Rule 1: Free Player Limit
**First 20 players are FREE, then pay per player.**

**How it works:**
1. Count organizer's total players across ALL competitions (any status)
2. Query: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM competition_user cu JOIN competition c ON cu.competition_id = c.id WHERE c.organiser_id = ?`
3. If count < 20: Player joins for free (no credit deduction)
4. If count >= 20: Deduct 1 from `app_user.paid_credit`

**Important notes:**
- ALL players in ALL competitions count (active, completed, any status)
- Same player in multiple competitions = multiple counts
- Example: Competition A (15 players) + Competition B (10 players) = 25 total count

### Rule 2: No Credit Refunds
**Once a player joins, the credit is consumed forever.**

- Competition ends? Players still count toward limit
- Player leaves mid-competition? Still counts
- Want to "free up" slots? Delete the entire competition (or buy more credits)
- **Like phone PAYG:** Once you use a minute, it's gone

**Rationale:**
- Simpler implementation (just count all rows)
- Prevents gaming the system
- Clear, predictable billing

### Rule 3: Credit Expiry
**Credits expire 12 months after purchase (T&Cs only - no automatic enforcement).**

**Implementation:**
- Terms & Conditions state: "Credits expire 12 months from purchase date"
- NO automatic expiry jobs or background processes
- If customer complains: admin can manually adjust or give credits
- **Business decision:** Engineering simplicity > strict enforcement

**Manual expiry process (if needed):**
1. Query old purchases: `SELECT * FROM credit_purchases WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '12 months'`
2. Manually deduct via admin panel or SQL
3. Log in `credit_transactions` (type: `'expiry'`)

### Rule 4: Credit Pack Pricing

**Pack Types:**
- **`starter_15`**: 15 credits for ¬£10 (67p per credit)
- **`popular_40`**: 40 credits for ¬£20 (50p per credit) - SAVE 25%
- **`value_100`**: 100 credits for ¬£40 (40p per credit) - BEST VALUE - SAVE 40%

**Marketing angle:**
- Volume discounts encourage larger purchases
- ¬£40 pack = best value (helps with Stripe fees)
- Clear progression: small/medium/large

---

## Credit Pack Configuration

**File:** `lmslocal-server/config/credit-packs.js`

```javascript
const CREDIT_PACKS = {
  starter_15: {
    credits: 15,
    price_gbp: 10,
    price_pence: 1000,
    name: 'Starter Pack',
    description: '15 credits - Perfect for small groups',
    per_credit_cost: 0.67
  },
  popular_40: {
    credits: 40,
    price_gbp: 20,
    price_pence: 2000,
    name: 'Popular Pack',
    description: '40 credits - Great value',
    per_credit_cost: 0.50,
    savings_percent: 25
  },
  value_100: {
    credits: 100,
    price_gbp: 40,
    price_pence: 4000,
    name: 'Best Value Pack',
    description: '100 credits - Maximum savings',
    per_credit_cost: 0.40,
    savings_percent: 40,
    badge: 'BEST VALUE'
  }
};

module.exports = {
  CREDIT_PACKS
};
```

## Integration Points

### When Player Joins Competition

**Current flow:** Player clicks "Join Competition" ‚Üí API adds to competition_user

**New flow:**
1. Player clicks "Join Competition"
2. Frontend calls join API
3. Backend:
   - Count organizer's total players
   - If >= 20: Call `deduct-credit` API
   - If successful: Add to competition_user
   - If failed: Return error
4. Frontend shows success or "Organizer needs to buy credits" error

**Files to modify:**
- `lmslocal-server/routes/join-competition.js` (or equivalent)
- Add call to `deduct-credit` logic

---

## Stripe Configuration

### Products to Create (Optional - Dynamic Pricing Works)

Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Products:

1. **Product:** "LMSLocal Credits - Starter Pack"
   - Price: ¬£10.00 GBP
   - Metadata: `pack_type=starter_15`, `credits=15`

2. **Product:** "LMSLocal Credits - Popular Pack"
   - Price: ¬£20.00 GBP
   - Metadata: `pack_type=popular_40`, `credits=40`

3. **Product:** "LMSLocal Credits - Best Value Pack"
   - Price: ¬£40.00 GBP
   - Metadata: `pack_type=value_100`, `credits=100`

**Note:** Not strictly required - `create-checkout-session` uses dynamic pricing.

---

## Background Jobs (REMOVED)

~~Monthly free credit refresh~~ - NOT NEEDED (no free tier refresh)
~~Credit expiry automation~~ - NOT NEEDED (manual process only)

**No background jobs required for this system.**

---

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Simplified to single balance** - No separate free/purchased tracking
2. **No automatic expiry** - T&Cs cover it, manual process if needed
3. **No batches table** - Over-engineering, manual expiry if needed
4. **All players count** - Any status, any competition, simple sum
5. **No refunds** - Like phone PAYG, credits used = credits gone
6. **Manual database updates in code** - No triggers, functions, constraints
7. **No dedicated pricing page** - Simple messaging on homepage instead
8. **Server-side only** - All business logic in Node.js, not database
9. **User identification** - created_by_user_id IS NULL = real organizer (can buy credits)
10. **Bot users** - created_by_user_id = 1 (system user)
11. **Guest players** - created_by_user_id = organizer's ID
12. **Configurable free tier** - FREE_PLAYER_LIMIT in .env (defaults to 20)

---

## Questions Resolved

‚úÖ What counts as "active player"? - ALL players in ALL competitions
‚úÖ Do unique players matter? - No, each join counts separately
‚úÖ Do credits refund when player leaves? - No, no refunds
‚úÖ How to handle expiry? - Manual only, T&Cs cover it
‚úÖ Need batches table? - No, over-engineered

## Quick Reference: What Works & What Doesn't

### ‚úÖ WORKING
- User registration (no longer creates user_allowance)
- Login/logout
- Competition creation
- Player joining competitions (but no credit deduction yet!)
- Dashboard views
- All non-payment features

### üö´ BROKEN / DISABLED
- Credit purchase (needs complete rewrite)
- Billing page (shows old subscription UI)
- Stripe webhook (needs rewrite for credits)
- Credit deduction on player join (TODO placeholder only)
- Billing history (queries wrong table)
- Promo code validation (uses old pricing)

### ‚è≥ TO BE BUILT
- Credit pack configuration
- Get user credits API
- Deduct credit API
- Purchase flow (checkout + webhook)
- Updated billing page
- Credit transaction history

## RESUME POINT (Context Compaction)

**What's Working:**
- ‚úÖ Server starts with no errors
- ‚úÖ Credit balance API works (`/get-user-credits`)
- ‚úÖ Credit deduction works (`/deduct-credit`)
- ‚úÖ Player joins now deduct credits if organizer has 20+ players
- ‚úÖ Organizers blocked from adding players if no credits remaining

**What's Working:**
- ‚úÖ Credit purchase flow (Stripe checkout ‚Üí webhook ‚Üí credits added)
- ‚úÖ Promo code validation and discount calculation
- ‚úÖ Credit deduction on player join (after 20 free players)
- ‚úÖ Credit refund on player removal (SETUP mode only)
- ‚úÖ Billing page UI with purchase history
- ‚úÖ Complete audit trail in credit_transactions

**Ready for Production:**
- All core PAYG features complete
- Payment processing tested and working
- Error handling and validation in place
- Database transactions ensure data integrity

**Important Files:**
- `/docs/PAYG-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` - This document (complete reference)
- `/docs/API-Rules.md` - Follow for all API development (POST only, HTTP 200, return_code)
- `/config/credit-packs.js` - Pack pricing (¬£10/15, ¬£20/40, ¬£40/100)
- `/.env` - FREE_PLAYER_LIMIT=20 (configurable)
- `.broken` files - Reference for promo validation logic (don't delete yet)

**Document Purpose:** Resume implementation from this point if session ends.
**Server Status:** Starts cleanly, core credit system works, payment flow pending
