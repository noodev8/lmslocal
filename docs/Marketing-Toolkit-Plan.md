# Marketing Toolkit for Organizers - Implementation Plan

## Vision

**Make organizers the heroes of their own competitions by giving them professional marketing tools that require zero design or copywriting skills.**

### Core Philosophy
LMS Local is a "marketing ammunition supplier" - we provide the content, graphics, and prompts that organizers can fire into their own channels (WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger) to keep their competitions exciting and engaging.

### Success Metrics
- Organizer engagement rate (% using marketing features)
- Player retention (competitions with active marketing vs without)
- Competition growth (sign-ups after marketing pushes)
- Organizer satisfaction (feedback and repeat usage)
