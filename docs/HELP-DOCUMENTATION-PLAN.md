# Help Documentation Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for implementing a comprehensive help documentation system for LMSLocal that serves both authenticated and non-authenticated users, provides SEO benefits, and creates a valuable resource for all user types.

## Core Objectives
- Create public-facing documentation accessible without authentication
- Provide context-aware help for authenticated users
- Optimize for search engines to drive organic traffic
- Build a scalable system for easy ongoing updates
- Support multiple content formats (text, images, videos)

## Scope (Phase 1)
- **Language**: English only
- **Access**: Online only (no offline/PWA support)
- **Content Management**: MDX files in codebase (no CMS)
- **Analytics**: Not included initially
- **Feedback System**: Not included initially
- **Help Chat Widget**: Future enhancement
- **API Documentation**: Future enhancement

```

### 🎯 Ready to Use
The help system is functional and can be accessed at:
- Development: http://localhost:3000/help

Content can be edited by modifying the `.mdx` files directly - changes appear immediately in development mode.

## Notes for Future Sessions

2. **Session 2**: Core content creation (how to play, getting started)
3. **Session 3**: FAQ and rules documentation
4. **Session 4**: Advanced guides and tutorials
5. **Session 5**: Search implementation and testing
6. **Session 6**: SEO optimization and meta tags

### Tools Needed (Phase 1)
