## Revenue Projections (Updated)
- 1,000 Pro users = Â£29k/month
- 100 Enterprise users = Â£7.9k/month
- Custom pricing deals: Â£5k/month (estimated)
- **Potential Total**: Â£41.9k/month = Â£502k/year

## Key Strategic Decisions

### Why These Prices?
- **Free tier**: 10 players is generous enough to demonstrate value
- **Pro at Â£29**: Sweet spot for most organizers, includes key business features
- **Enterprise at Â£79**: Premium automation justifies higher price point
- **No unlimited players**: Forces upgrade conversations, keeps infrastructure manageable

### Features Deliberately Excluded (Too Early)
- **API access**: Complex documentation, SDK development, support overhead
